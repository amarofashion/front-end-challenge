# Amaro Challenge

## Running the Application

You'll need a computer with *nodejs*, *node-sass* and *yarn* installed, latest versions recommended.

Run `yarn install` to install the project dependencies.

To start the development local server, run `yarn start`.

### Stack

To build this small application I'm using a react/redux environment for the application logic and SASS for stylesheets.
