# AMARO front-end challenge

The objective of this challenge is to build a catalog page for some _best-sellers_ of AMARO history.

**NOTE:** Portuguese version available [here](o-desafio.md).

## Rules

- The page can't be static. It needs some logic to show all products dinamically.
- All products from `products.json` must be shown.
- In case you choose to use some _build_ tool (Grunt, Gulp, npm, Webpack, etc), don't forget to create an instructions guide to allow us to run the project.
- If you got some questions, Google them or ask your friends. But do not ask them to solve the challenge for you.

## Requirements

- The page must be responsive. If possible, use a _mobile-first_ approach.
- FOr each item on the catalog, the following information must be present on the page:
    - Image
    - Name
    - Price
    - Promo Status
    - Promo price (if there's one)
    - Available Sizes
- It must be possible to add products to the cart.
- It must be possible to verify how much and what items are on the cart.

## Bonus points

- Easy as pie? So add more functionality to cart allowing users to add, remove and change quantity of cart items.
- Oh! Don't forget to show total value of cart.
- Want more challenges? Add a filter to show only products `on_sale`.
- Some products don't have all sizes available. Show only the ones on stock.
- We like clean and testable code, right? Sincerely, we don't do an excellent code on this department, so this is a big bonus point.

## How we'll evaluate

- Your code will be evaluated by: semantics, structure, legibility, size, among other factors.
- The `git` history will be avaluated.
- Our stack here is React based (React, Redux, Sass, Webpack). In case you are familiar with it, you can use it to solve the challenge.
- We're looking for a front-end developer who knows how to build a layout and also knows how to programming in JavaScript. Use this as an opportunity to show us how good you are on both areas.
- Do not forget documentation. Or how are we going to evaluate your work if we can't init the project on our machines? :thinking_face:

## Got questions?

- The challenge is harder than you anticipated? Contact us opening an _issue_. We're looking for a more experienced developer but we'll also consider someone who is eager to learn.
